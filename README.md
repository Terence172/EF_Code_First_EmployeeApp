# Assignment 4 - Entity Framework Code First
### SECP3106 - Section 01
<br>
This Repository contains files to the Employee Data System that was created as a part of my assesment for Application Development Course. I used Microsoft Visual Studio to complete this assesment, and also Microsoft SSMS for the database technology. The following application is built on ASP.NET Web Application (.Net Framework)  with MVC implemented. EF Code First Development Approach was used for the development process.

Feel free to suggest any improvements.
